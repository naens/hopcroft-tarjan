#+TITLE: Planar Graph Exercise

Hello, this project contains an exercise for the book Art Of Prolog
(14.1(vii)).  It is supposed to implement the Hopcroft and Tarjan algorithm
in order to test whether a graph is planar or not.  In order to implement
the algorithm, I decided to follow the paper of William Kocay, /The
Hopcroft-Tarjan Planarity Algorithm/ (October 1993).

In order to make it more exciting, easier to understand, and visually more
interesting, I decided to draw every step using graphviz.  It seems that
it's possible that it display the vertices and edges exactly as it needs to
be in order to draw planar graphs without intersections.

As this algorithm requires several steps, I will make it possible to show
each step and each value calculated for vertices in the process.
